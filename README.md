# Adventures in OpenCV

Toying around with OpenCV. An attempt at detecting the most luminescent window given a set of windows in a frame in real time. Man, C++ is fast.

Note this currently only builds under OSX.

1. Install OpenCV via ports: `port install opencv'
  1. Note: Building from source doesn't actually work.
1. Run `make`
1. Run `./ocv` to launch.

Yay!
